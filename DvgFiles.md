# DvgFiles <sup><sub>`v2.0`</sub></sup>
For many programs I've made, you will need a DvgFiles installation. It comes with **one** invisible folder, you don't need to worry about many folders created, so your files will be clean. And, it gives all the apps that need it a place to put their own folder, all inside a single folder, `.DvgFiles`.

### Installation
Pastebin: [`SKTUK0rb`](http://pastebin.com/SKTUK0rb)

Before you start, make sure the [`http`](http://www.computercraft.info/wiki/HTTP_(API)) api [is enabled](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/17533-how-to-enable-the-http-api/).
Then, type in the console:

    > pastebin run SKTUK0rb

### Contents
The folder structure is as follows:

```
.DvgFiles / data /
          / temp /
          / APIs / dvg
                   ti
                   dvgapps
          / boot / programs /
                   BIOS
                   config.cfg
          / version
