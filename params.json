It comes with **one** invisible folder, you don't need to worry about many folders created. And, it gives all the apps that need it a place to put their own folder, all inside a single folder, `.DvgFiles`.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nPastebin: [`SKTUK0rb`](http://pastebin.com/SKTUK0rb)\r\n\r\nBefore you start, make sure the [`http`](http://www.computercraft.info/wiki/HTTP_(API)) api is enabled.\r\nThen, type in the console:\r\n\r\n    > pastebin run SKTUK0rb\r\n\r\n### Contents\r\nThe folder structure is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.DvgFiles / data / Dvg /\r\n          / APIs / dvg\r\n                   ti\r\n                   dvgapps\r\n          / boot / BIOS\r\n                   config.cfg\r\n```\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<hr>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n# Read global <sup><sub>`v1.0`</sub></sup>\r\nRead is a global program, that means you can access it from anyehere on your computer, like `edit`, `ls`, `mv` and `cp`.\r\nIt lets you read a file. Just read. No editing and such.\r\n\r\nAnd as a nice addition, if you have an advanced computer, you can make readme files with color markup!\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nTo use normal read mode, type anywhere in the console:\r\n\r\n    > read <file>\r\n\r\nTo use markup read mode, type:\r\n\r\n    > read <file> markup\r\n\r\nThe format of a marked up file is as follows. In this version, no spaces are allowed between the color and the `:`. This will be added in the future.\r\n\r\n    color:string\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n1. Download the file and place it in the following folder: `.DvgFiles/programs`. Pastebin: [`bw8EKigW`](http://pastebin.com/bw8EKigW).\r\n2. Every time you startup the computer, this program will become global.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<hr>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n# Archive <sup><sub>`v2.1`</sub></sup>\r\nWith archive, you can put all your files and folders (inside folders inside folders...) in one singe file. It works a bit like winrar of 7zip. This is very useful for downloading and installing many files and folders, so you only need to download **one single file!**\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nTo pack a folder, type in the console:\r\n\r\n    > archive pack <path to folder> <path to file>\r\n\r\nTo unpack, just change `pack` to `unpack`.\r\nThe `path to folder` is the folder with your files, and the `path to file` is the archive file.\r\n\r\nFor unpacking, only the archive file has to exist and for packing, only the folder has to exist. The rest doesn't **have** to exist, but it may exist.\r\n\r\nArchive is also able to add files to an archive, without unpacking and re-packing. The syntax for this function is:\r\n\r\n    > archive add <path to archive> [folder in archive] <path to file>\r\n\r\nHere, path to file means the path to the file to add.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nThis is the folder `afolder`:\r\n\r\n    file1\r\n    file2\r\n    folder1:    fldfile1\r\n                fldfile2\r\n                fldfld:     fldfldfile\r\n\r\nTo make an archive of it and create the file `thefile`, we type:\r\n\r\n    > archive pack afolder thefile\r\n\r\nTo unpack it in the folder `blah`, we type:\r\n\r\n    > archive unpack blah thefile\r\n\r\nTo add the file `foo` to the folder `folder1/fldfld` inside `thefile`, we type:\r\n\r\n    > archive add thefile folder1/fldfld foo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n*Coming soon...*\r\n","google":"UA-42400051-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
