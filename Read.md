# Read global <sup><sub>`v1.0`</sub></sup>
Read is a global program, that means you can access it from anyehere on your computer, like `edit`, `ls`, `mv` and `cp`.
It lets you read a file. Just read. No editing and such.

And as a nice ~~little~~ addition, if you have an advanced computer, you can make readme files with color markup!

### Usage
To use normal read mode, type anywhere in the console:

    > read <file>

To use markup read mode, type:

    > read <file> markup

The format of a marked up file is as follows. In the current version, **no spaces are allowed between the color and the `:`**. This will be added in the future.

    color:string

### Installation
Download the file and place it in the following folder: `.DvgFiles/programs`. Pastebin: [`bw8EKigW`](http://pastebin.com/bw8EKigW).
Every time you startup the computer, this program will become global.
